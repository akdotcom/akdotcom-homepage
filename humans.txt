Hi, I'm Akshay. Nice to meet you.

I'm the Founder/CEO of Stitch, the simple, free way to stay in touch with the people
you care about.

I was recently the platform lead @ Foursquare which was a fun mix
of product, engineering, business development, sales, and community. Prior to that I
was an engineer at Google for almost 6 years. And before that I was at MIT where I
studied Math & Computer Science.

I built the first version of a mildly successful chat system called Partychat in 2005,
which has since been improved and maintained by a number of my friends. I once helped
a Japanese parody music video called "Yatta" go viral in the early aughts
(back before YouTube) by hosting it in my MIT web locker.

I'm married, live in Brooklyn, and have two cats.

My e-mail address is my first initial plus last name at gmail.com
