Hi, I'm Akshay. Nice to meet you.

I work in tech doing product management. I'm currently a product director at Shopify.

Previously I worked on the Lyft rider experience, encouraged more genuine human
connections at Beme, tried starting a company in Samsung Accelerator, helped
developers build cool shit with Foursquare's APIs, and built some fun blog and
search related stuff at Google. Before all that I went to MIT where I studied
Math & Computer Science.

I built the first version of a mildly successful chat system called Partychat in 2005.
I helped a Japanese parody music video called "Yatta" go viral in the early aughts
(back before YouTube) by hosting it in my MIT web locker.

I'm married, live in Brooklyn, and have two cats.

My e-mail address is my first initial plus last name at gmail.com
